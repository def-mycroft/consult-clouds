## Purpose

Promptlib exists to make archived prompts _actively useful_ in creative work.  
It reduces friction between writing, reuse, and evolution of prompts.  
It aims to surface the right prompt at the right time — in flow, not afterthought.

---

## Design Philosophy

Promptlib is a _creative partner_, not just a tool.  
It helps evolve both the archive and the writer.  
It prioritizes _speed of access_, _personal feel_, and _adaptive growth_.  
It stays light, non-intrusive, ready to serve.

## Core Goals

- Surface forgotten but valuable prompts
    
- Make reuse natural and habitual
    
- Reduce cognitive effort in finding prompts
    
- Encourage live evolution of prompts
    
- Shape a healthy, lean archive over time
    
- Reflect and support the user’s style and voice
    
- Build trust: the archive is alive, useful, and worth growing

## Key Features (first pass)

- **Fast interactive browse** — surfaces prompts by context, search, or habit
    
- **Low-friction reuse** — copy, view, insert in seconds
    
- **Sub-second startup** — instant access builds trust
    
- **Simple prompt evolution** — light ways to annotate or revise
    
- **Context-aware surfacing** — aligns prompts to current project or mode
    
- **Personal rhythm** — adapts subtly to how the user works
    
- **Anti-clutter bias** — prevents bloat, keeps archive lean
    

---

## Tone and Feel

Promptlib should feel like part of _my writing self_.  
Not a corporate tool, not a heavy manager.  
It should be light, fast, personal, alive.  
Something I _want_ to use, daily or weekly — not a chore.

---

## Outcome

A promptlib that makes it easy and fun to reuse, refine, and grow prompts —  
and that subtly deepens the writer’s own style and creative flow.
